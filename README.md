# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

My Project

This project is an app inspired by Reddit. A space where users can come and read up on articles, comment on them and even vote for their favourite.

Users can search for articles from a number of topics.

The wireframe for this project is in a designated file called 'wireframe'. It contains two files:

- Spider diagram of the infrastructure (components, state and endpoints mapping).
- Illustration of the layout and design.
